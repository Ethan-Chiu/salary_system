# For Developer

## Contribute

- Let's create a branch before developing a issue.

- Strict type enforcement.


## Coding Convention

- The name of the extracted component should start with **Comp**.
- The name for files and directories should use lower case and underscore.
- The file name should match the default exported name.

## Usage
1. install `yarn`.
2. Run the command `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the command `yarn dev` to enter develop mode. 
4. Then open browser (or use `curl` command) to check the website. The project will be launched at `http://localhost:3000/`.
